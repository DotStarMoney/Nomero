- PHASE 1 - start 1/15/15

TODO:
Add in dynamic shadows
Add player shadow casting
Add in 2 test electronic items with light bleed overlays. Do a scope and a randomizing tube.
fix path tracker crash when deleting edges mid-record
pathtracker needs to split nodes if there are objects in the way.
get player friction right
fix path tracking dingus manuevers, enemies getting stuck
pathtracker saves recordings for enemy property groups, switchable during record
add tinydynamic level importing, implement two versions.
verify tinydynamic toggle platforms
add conveyer belts and slippery blocks
player loses momentum when dying
remove ladder jumps
teach enemies to walk on moving platforms and destroyed platforms 
add second enemy type, add different input types for enemies, including those that are stationary.
program group thinking for enemies
	enemies react and are damaged by bombs and level hazards
	enemies think together to activate switches to cross gaps
	enemies alert each other to sightings and call for help
	enemies hunt the player, take different paths.
program enemy death animation
fix jump mid-air direction, facillitate through animation class
bombs should be more damaging to the player
get elliott to utilize flipped owp
Enemy shadow casting
many mr. spy fixes:
	hat flattens during jump, jump is silly to begin with
	run needs an improvement
add foreground cover layer for effects like smoke
make smoke look/behave better for cover, new steam and smoke animation
create directional destructible chain blocks that don't get blown up unless an adjacent block blows up.
create various owp destructible blocks that match non-owp destructibles
program new destructible blocks
deactivated bombs play sound and show effect
bomb indicators when you're on a different map
add bomb memory between maps
add deactivation effect for mines
add crouch to place bomb, and bomb placement scheme, bombs on walls unstick if moved or destroyed
new jump animation
add full set of explosion blox
add money items and add when enemy killed
spline, electric shock cgi
mr.spy silhouette looks odd
change tile animations so each tile has an index to effect data in the tileset so no hash lookup

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MODIFIED:
rotation in blitters - computes rotation and caches, faster and easier

POSTPONED:
animation bug: sliding after death - can't reproduce
tinyspace bug: sticking, STILL something to do with OWP corners - cannot reproduce

IGNORED:
SSE implementation of fallout - doubtful the speed benefit is worth it
bug in alpha blend routine causing jaggies across screen when mines towards edge - commented out < 4 case 


NON-ISSUE:
collision with pain blocks should be circle to box - tried, but seems to make more sense visually when box to box

COMPLETED:
explode all button (must release to activate)
deactivate all button (must release to activate), press number to deactivate just that one
remove SSE4 dependence - now requires minimum SSE2
Jumping forgives pressing jump early before hitting surface by a few frames
animation bug: quick touchdowns starting walk which is not cancelled during free fall - fixed
mine indicators should lock to screen wiggle
player should not get stuck when out of bounds, should just fall
cover layers
	player has computed visibility
		animation caches non-transparent per frame, count non transparent matches in region, divide by total
make sure path tracker isn't splitting long nodes - fixed by implementing proper in place array shift
added HUD spinner
frame delay now using system timer, gives OS a chance to do some stuff
add specular channel to normal map
optimized light cast routine with bump support (diffuse and specular map textures) 

KNOWN ODDITIES:
in Player.computeCoverage, sprite comparison requires that character be a multiple of 16 for now
Landing on a slope after a jump and releasing forward and immediately jumping afterword can really boost your speed
Landing on a slope after a jump up it and immediately jumping afterword can give you a super jump (hard to trigger)
draw mask technique causes rare missed tile artifacts (visible seams in layers)


- PHASE 2 -
Add other bomb types
door indicators
door keys
if holding crouch and jumping, landing causes funny little animation glitch
cache segment measurements for speed and implement sleeping state, causing big slow-down in physics without
effects reacting to bombs and other triggers
remove old ass code (like fbtriggers, "parent" pointers where should be link, 
super speed jump should still work, but remove slowdown that occurs if pressing forward during superjump
background tiles that trees are above don't look so good
fix snow bunching in corner and allow amount to be varried.
