- PHASE 1 - start 1/15/15

TODO:
fix path tracking dingus manuevers, enemies getting stuck
fix path tracker crash when deleting edges mid-record
pathtracker needs to split nodes if there are objects in the way.
pathtracker saves recordings for enemy property groups, switchable during record
add tinydynamic level importing, implement two versions.
verify tinydynamic toggle platforms
add conveyer belts and slippery blocks
player loses momentum when dying
teach enemies to walk on moving platforms and destroyed platforms 
add second enemy type, add different input types for enemies, including those that are stationary.
program group thinking for enemies
	enemies react and are damaged by bombs and level hazards
	enemies think together to activate switches to cross gaps
	enemies alert each other to sightings and call for help
	enemies hunt the player, take different paths.
optimized light cast routine with bump support (diffuse and specular map textures) 
player and objects contained by "items" are drawn in silouhette
program enemy death animation
fix jump mid-air direction, facillitate through animation class
bombs should be more damaging to the player
get elliott to utilize flipped owp
many mr. spy fixes:
	hat flattens during jump, jump is silly to begin with
	run needs an improvement
add foreground cover layer for effects like smoke
make smoke look/behave better for cover, new steam and smoke animation
create directional destructible chain blocks that don't get blown up unless an adjacent block blows up.
create various owp destructible blocks that match non-owp destructibles
program new destructible blocks
deactivated bombs play sound and show effect
bomb indicators when you're on a different map
add bomb memory between maps
add deactivation effect for mines
add crouch to place bomb, and bomb placement scheme, bombs on walls unstick if moved or destroyed
new jump animation
add money items and add when enemy killed
spline, electric shock cgi

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MODIFIED:
rotation in blitters - computes rotation and caches, faster and easier

POSTPONED:
animation bug: sliding after death - can't reproduce
tinyspace bug: sticking, STILL something to do with OWP corners - cannot reproduce

IGNORED:
SSE implementation of fallout - doubtful the speed benefit is worth it
bug in alpha blend routine causing jaggies across screen when mines towards edge - commented out < 4 case 

NON-ISSUE:
collision with pain blocks should be circle to box - tried, but seems to make more sense visually when box to box

COMPLETED:
explode all button (must release to activate)
deactivate all button (must release to activate), press number to deactivate just that one
remove SSE4 dependence - now requires minimum SSE2
Jumping forgives pressing jump early before hitting surface by a few frames
animation bug: quick touchdowns starting walk which is not cancelled during free fall - fixed
mine indicators should lock to screen wiggle
player should not get stuck when out of bounds, should just fall
cover layers
	player has computed visibility
		animation caches non-transparent per frame, count non transparent matches in region, divide by total

KNOWN ODDITIES:
in Player.computeCoverage, sprite comparison requires that character be a multiple of 16 for now
Landing on a slope after a jump and releasing forward and immediately jumping afterword can really boost your speed
Landing on a slope after a jump up it and immediately jumping afterword can give you a super jump




- PHASE 2 -
Add other bomb types
door indicators
door keys
if holding crouch and jumping, landing causes funny little animation glitch
mask out fully covered squares for speed
effects reacting to bombs and other triggers
remove old ass code (like fbtriggers, "parent" pointers where should be link, 
super speed jump should still work, but remove slowdown that occurs if pressing forward during superjump
